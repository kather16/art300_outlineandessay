<h1>THE PAPER</h1>
<p>In Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize winning book, The Color Purple, Celie, a poor African American woman, finds her voice through the letters she writes to God about the harsh realities of her life. Her stepfather, Alphonso, sexually abuses her after her mother dies, and she becomes pregnant at the age fourteen. Walker describes the story with colors that reflect the mood of the situation.  For example, Celie describes her bruised as purple, black, and blue. As she discovers freedom through her letters and female relationships, those dark colors turn brighter.  The New York Review of Books describes the novel as “remarkable expressiveness, color and poignancy...not only a memorable and infinitely touching character but a whole submerged world is vividly called into being.” Walker’s The Color Purple probes through the black and white topic of sexism and male dominance. However, Walker adds complexity by using color symbolism to show the psychological effects of various colors, allowing the readers to see both the positive and the negative aspects in the characters and situations. 
</p>
<p>People often associate color with different emotions, ideas and elements of the earth. Certain colors have psychological effects and can have a profound impact on someone’s life or response to a situation. There are ways to detect one’s mood through color. For example, the mood ring associates color with the temperature of the body. Though the mood ring has not been scientifically proven and serves as simply a pop culture toy that attracts customers, the core idea that color and emotions do correspond is scientifically proven. When the body temperature increases, the mood ring turns darker colors like red or purple to express passion, energy, and happiness. When the ring turns yellow, orange, or black, it means the blood flow has retracted from the fingers and that the energy has moved, expressing stress or anxiety. Studies show that people tend to correlate the color red with energy, danger, power, fire and blood. The red stop sign and a red light both mean stop, warning danger ahead if precautions are not taken. Orange and yellow are often associated with happiness, attraction, childish energy, passion, and creativity. Green symbolizes growth, freshness, healing and hope. Blue, the color of the sky and water, symbolizes loyalty, faith, cleanness and tranquility. People may associate black with death, power, evil and mystery. Black can also be very formal, elegant, and can give depth and perspective. In The Color Purple, all of these colors act as underlying symbols that reflect the character’s emotions and situations. However, given the title of the book, Walker focuses on the color purple. The color purple changes from dark and gloomy to romantic, feminine, dignified, mysterious and independent.  Walker conveys the color purple as positive and negative throughout the story. However, as Celie finds her voice, the color purple shines brighter. 
</p>
<p>Walker writes the novel in Celie’s point of view through a series of letters that she writes to God and her sister. This acts as her journal where she can write about the terrible things she endures and overcomes. She uses impersonal language and broken English to convey the point bluntly. Most of her letters at the beginning barely hit the surface of how she truly feels because she can simply not express it. For a long time, this journal keeps her in this bubble where she cannot open up and she simply does not have a voice to stand up for herself. Her father tells her after sexually abusing her, “You better not never tell nobody but God. It’d kill your mammy” (Walker, 1). Many people can relate because “from the first line of the book... the reader instantly identifies with fourteen- year- old Celie, who is caught in the horror of incest and abuse,” (Abrams). This not only diminishes her respect for her father, but her respect for herself. She talks to God with hope, expressing her ideas and the pain she endures. She writes, “ He start to choke me, saying You better shut up and git used to it” (Walker, 1). Celie is so scared of her father that she feels inferior to him, however she “don’t never git used to it.” Walker describes the abuse Celie endures as bruises eggplant colored, symbolizing the sadness and gloom the color purple reflects in this part of her life. 
</p>
<p>Throughout the novel, Celie grows with the help of strong female relationships. She meets Shug Avery, a confident, strong willed, beautiful woman whom Celie admires greatly. Shug cares for Celie and plays both the role of a mother figure, a friend, sister, and a lover to Celie. Through Shug’s independent and forward erotic nature, Celie finds her voice and discovers love. Shug convinces Celie that not all sexual activity is sad and undesirable, but that with the right person, it can truly be a gift from God. To help Celie wrap her head around this, Shug gives Celie a mirror to go look at her private parts and see them in a new light. Shug tells Celie that she and her sexual parts are beautiful like purple orchids and lilacs not just purple bruises.This gives Celie confidence and pride in herself. Celie’s relationship with Shug empowers her to stand up for herself and be confident in her true beauty. 
        Mr. ______, Celie’s husband, also abuses her and diminishes her dignity. In addition, he hides all the letters Celie has received from her sister, Nettie, who is a missionary in Africa. Celie, therefore, does not even know if her sister is alive. With the encouragement of Mr. ______’s sister, Kate, Celie stands up for herself against Mr ______ and demands to see the letters when she finds out about them. Kate takes Celie shopping for a new dress and the only colors they find are brown, maroon, and dark blue, but later Celie and Sofia uses bright yellow fabric from Shug’s dress to stitch a quilt when Celie feels more confident. After being called out on about the abuse, Mr. ______ drastically changes his life and becomes a friend of Celie’s. Mr. ______ even paints his house white, symbolizing a turn, a new beginning in his life. This color symbolism allows readers to see both the good and bad in every situation. Through the abuse with purple bruises, Celie becomes a strong and independent purple orchid. Through abusing, Mr. ______ finds a new beginning in his freshly painted white house. Colors change throughout the book and develop new meaning and purpose.
</p>
<p>Alice Walker uses colors to to show the psychological effects and connotations of various colors. Stereotypes that people associate colors with parallels to how female african americans were stereotyped at this time. This black and white topic of patriarchy and sex abuse seems simple, but adding the colors to describe the moods and show the effects of being abused is very complex. Walker portrays both the complexities in the characters and situations in order to show the glass half full instead of half empty. She shows that people are not just rotten from the beginning, but their actions sprout from something they  went through. For example, Harpo,  Mr. ______’s eldest son, only abuses Sophia, Harpo’s wife, because he wants to prove to his father and to her that he can be strong and powerful like his father is to him. The reason Celie is so helpless and sad is because she endured sexual abuse when she was just a child. 
        Walker shows that experiences, especially those with memorable colors and descriptions, mold someone into who they are as a person and who they aspire to be. Walker highlights the color purple among the colors because “it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it. People think pleasing God is all God cares about. But any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back,” (Walker, 196) The color purple changes throughout the story, showing the complexities of stereotyping a color. Parallel to this, Alice Walker shows the complexities of stereotyping an African American woman.
